## Additional Considerations

2. **Marketing and Sales Budget**
   - Allocate 10-15% of revenue for marketing and sales activities once revenue reaches $25,000/month

3. **Research and Development Fund**
   - Allocate 5-10% of revenue for ongoing R&D to maintain competitive edge

4. **Legal and Accounting Services**
   - Budget $1,000 - $2,000/month for professional services to ensure compliance and financial health

5. **Employee Stock Option Pool (ESOP)**
   - Consider setting aside 10-15% of company equity for future employees

6. **Advisory Board Compensation**
   - Budget for potential advisory board members (e.g., 0.5-1% equity vested over 2 years per advisor)

## Potential Action Items
1. Develop a detailed cash flow projection for the next 18 months
2. Create a fundraising strategy to support operations until break-even point
3. Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) for each revenue stream
4. Develop a customer acquisition strategy focusing on high-value, low-cost channels
5. Create a timeline for hiring additional team members based on revenue milestones
6. Implement financial tracking and reporting systems for accurate monitoring

## Conclusion
This roadmap outlines our path from pre-revenue to operational stability, focusing on maintaining our infrastructure and fairly compensating our founding team. By setting clear milestones and considering additional financial factors, we position ourselves for sustainable growth and success.

Regular review and adjustment of this plan will be crucial as we navigate the early stages of our business. Our primary focus should be on rapid product development, securing initial clients, and maintaining lean operations until we achieve stable revenue.
