## Insights
### Ruby and ESL (sockets)
would be wise to play with https://developer.signalwire.com/freeswitch/FreeSWITCH-Explained/Configuration/CDR/CDR-via-ESL_3965102
but use the ruby library
why is this wise?  talk to claude. 

### freeswitch speech to text
it seems that somewhere freeswitch has a speech to text functionality built-in. 
If this can be near real-time, then we may end up simulating mini-omni's approach, but with a better model that begins with text, spawns text, then we use a voice to read that text back through the phone.
