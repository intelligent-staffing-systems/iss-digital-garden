title: Hey Jake - IPS
---

Hey Jake,

I believe ISS should no longer be our focus.  
Our focus should be oriented to a new business.
A business I want to start from scratch with you.  

Our LLC will be called "Intelligent Proprietary Systems", or IPS.  
IPS enables individuals and businesses to own and manage their own software. 

IPS allows us to build a business while supplementing our careers. 
We are building our own own web-development factory, piece by piece;
Which we will use to build our own successful applications,
which we will use as a portfolio to get big-ticket clients.  

We will build a system that allows us to either sell it as a business, 
OR we can outsource it's management and make passive income while maintaining control.  
Either way, me and you live the rest of our lives rich and free.  

True retirement is not in the 401k - it's in building our own business.
We will build this brick by brick, with the help of our AI agents and automation pipelines. 
The key to our business's success is building an effective IDP (internal development platform)
An IDP that enables small, elite business and development teams to build any imaginable software.  
An IDP that protects owners from over-dependency and deprecation.  
An IDP that we ourselves use as a template when building software.  
An IDP that allows us to teach businesses how to manage their own software. 

As AI improves, more businesses and individuals will want their own custom solutions.  
There are consistent needs accross many fields of business -
such as identify management, pipelines, security, communication -
Yet every business needs custom features -
such as connecting AI to manuals, compliance communications, and much more.
The need for business to build out their own software is only going to grow.  
We want to lead the market in building software and training businesses. 

Once we have the platform built out, a few profitable websites, and a blog in our portfolio,
then we can use my dad, Paul, and other connections, 
and we promise them a percentage of any business they can get to sign with us.  
We can be a referral-based system.  
We can also use venture capitalists, who can recommend or utilize us. 

In this way, we become an incentive-based system that is based upon proven case-studies.  

# Best Next Steps
Again, this is more of a long term plan, though hopefully not more than a couple years to start making profits.  

## Lucas
I am going to focus on:
- Get my certs in everything - all azure and kubstronaut
	- all from the perspective of IPS - building it out hypothetically.  
	- Prepares us to build out a scalable IDP
	- Established credibility for big-ticket sales. 
- Get another DevOps job
	- Use that income to build our IDP.  
- Build out an IDP web development factory for a small, elite team.  
	- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
		- me and Jake build multiple profitable websites 
		- utilizes clou-native technologies
- Use my Dad and Paul and salesman - they simply get a passive percentage of any business they get to use our service

## Jake
I recommend you focus on:
- developing a vision for a website you believe will make money
- use Lucas as a resource for collaboration and automation. 

# conclusion
By both of us getting more and more corporate exposure through our jobs and studies, we will also be building our business over time, piece by piece, and with piece of mind, investing in ourselves and the key technologies that we believe are going to shape the future, which will one day fruit into our own successful small businesses, managing a b2b enterprise, and ultimately living our best lives.
